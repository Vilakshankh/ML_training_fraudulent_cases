# Fraudulent Credit Transaction Detection
## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a major issue that impacts individuals and financial institutions worldwide. In order to combat this issue, it is important to develop methods to accurately identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. In this project, I use machine learning techniques to build a model that can predict fraudulent credit transactions.

## Data
The data used in this project is a collection of credit card transactions, with each row representing a single transaction. The data includes various attributes of the transaction such as the amount, the time it was made, and the name of the sender and receiver. The data also includes a label indicating whether the transaction was fraudulent or not.

## Preprocessing
Before building our model, I must first preprocess the data. This includes encoding the categorical data (e.g. the names of the sender and receiver), and scaling the numerical data so that all features are on the same scale.

## Model Building
Next, I split the preprocessed data into a training set and a test set. I use the training set to fit a logistic regression model to the data. This model is then used to make predictions on the test set.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of our model, I use the precision score. This metric measures the proportion of correct positive predictions made by the model. A higher precision score indicates that the model is more accurate at identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Conclusion
Using machine learning, I was able to build a model that can accurately predict fraudulent credit transactions. This model can be used by financial institutions to prevent fraudulent activity and protect their customers.
